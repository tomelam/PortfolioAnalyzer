# This portfolio was constructed to make drawdowns very small while maintaining an
# annualised return of 10% or above, using a conservative portfolio design
# emphasising stability over aggressive growth. Here's the approach:
#
# * Include a lot of exposure to debt and hybrid funds: corporate bonds, hybrid
#   funds, and balanced advantage funds, thus minimising volatility.
# * Minimise exposure to pure equity funds, particularly to international equity
#   and sectoral funds, as they tend to amplify volatility.
# * Emphasise stability and diversification by adding gold.
# * Include conservative dynamic funds that adjust their equity/debt allocation
#   based on market conditions.
