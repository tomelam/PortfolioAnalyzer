# Portfolio 2
#
# This portfolio was created basically just to add gold to Portfolio 1, using a gold mutual fund.
#
# As of 1 Dec., 2024, results were:
#
# * Cumulative returns of about 370%.
# * The peak drawdowns for 2020, 2022, and 2024 were about 62%, 62%, and 18%, respectively.
#
# Here's the approach:
# * Add back gold to add diversification to the portfolio. Gold often has a low correlatioin with equities
#   and bonds, providing a hedge against market volatility.
# * Gold can act as a safeguard against inflationary pressures.
