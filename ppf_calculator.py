    """
    Calculate the daily cumulative gain series for a PPF investment.
    
    - The annual interest rate is forward-filled to apply the correct rate each day.
    - The annual rate is converted to a daily effective rate using:
          daily_effective_rate = (1 + annual_rate / 100) ** (1 / 365) - 1
    - The cumulative gain is compounded daily.

    Parameters:
        ppf_interest_rates (pd.DataFrame): DataFrame with a 'rate' column and datetime index.
                                           Rates are in percentages.
        portfolio_start_date (str or pd.Timestamp): The portfolioâ€™s start date.
    
    Returns:
        pd.DataFrame: A DataFrame with a daily cumulative gain series in the column 'ppf_value'.
