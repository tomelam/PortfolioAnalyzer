| **GPT-4**           | 40 msgs          | every 3 h             | Advanced general-purpose with strong CoT reasoning; retired from ChatGPT on Apr 30, 2025.  |
| **GPT-4o**          | 80 msgs          | every 3 h             | “Omni” successor to GPT-4 with native vision/audio support, faster & more consistent.          |
| **GPT-4.5 (Orion)** | ~50 msgs         | per week              | Feb 2025 research preview; excels at conversation & EQ, limited chain-of-thought.              |
| **o4-mini**         | 150 msgs         | daily at 00:00 UTC    | Lightweight GPT-4o variant for general use; lower latency, daily cap instead of rolling window.|
| **o4-mini-high**    | 50 msgs          | daily at 00:00 UTC    | High-performance o4-mini tuned for coding, STEM & logical tasks.                               |
| **o3**              | 50 msgs          | per week              | Original o‑series model; legacy; weaker than o4 variants.                                      |
| **o3-mini**         | 150 msgs         | daily at 00:00 UTC    | Compact model for fast answers & summaries; less depth on complex CoT reasoning.               |
| **o3-mini-high**    | 50 msgs          | daily at 00:00 UTC    | Enhanced o3-mini variant optimized for coding/debugging tasks.                                 |
| **o1-preview**      | 50 msgs          | per week              | Very early public reasoning model; largely superseded by o3 series.                            |
| **DALL·E 3**        | 40 prompts       | every 3 h; 200 imgs/day | In-chat image generation; supports free-form and in-context ops.                             |
| **Deep Research**   | 10 queries       | per month             | Academic-style search & analysis tool.                                                         |
